git init = initialize a Git repository, only use ONCE per project
git add = add a file to the staging area of the repo you have initialized

git status = displays the status of your Git repository

-m “*” when committing a Git repo = makes a comment on this repo (best practice to always add a quality comment)

git log = displays the identifying information captured by your last commit

git show * = where * is the hash of the commit, which is available in the git log, displays the actual contents (not just identifying information, the contents itself) of the last commit

“head” = a term for where you are right now in the Git directory status

“branch” = a term for a fork off of a directory status

git branch * = creates a new branch named whatever list where the asterisk is (do not need “”)

git branch = displays all current branches of this Git repository

git checkout * = changes your position to the * listed branch

touch * = creates an empty file (ex: touch git_notes.txt creates a new file with no content within it)
