1: On a scale of 0 - 10, how likely are you to recommend this workshop to a friend?

Ten. It was a good class, certainly was much better than the online tutorials I did, although I do think doing a bunch of tutorials ahead of time helped.

2: What aspects of the workshop did you like?

I liked the friendly, relaxed atmosphere, and the way it was broken up into small sections with breaks in between so as not to be overwhelming. The combination of styles (lecture/slides for about half, interactive use of the editor and terminal to interact with Git and GitHub for about half) was great, too. I personally liked that there were two people primarily teaching the class, rather than just one, and that there was a lot of input and interaction with the TAs. Everyone was very kind and helpful.

3: What aspects of the workshop would you change?

While I really like the introductions at the beginning, I felt like we ran out of time and got rushed at the end. More time could have been spent on Git, and GitHub especially. I thought we would have time to do the final assignment in class. Installing the SSH keys for GitHub probably should have been part of the pre-work, as it also took up a lot of valuable class time, and many of us already had an SSH key, so we were really just sitting there. There was an issue with Alex being locked out of his GitHub account (which I think had more to do with the SSH key setup than anything) that was no big deal, but probably could be easily avoided for future classes.


Thanks again for the great class, I really enjoyed it!


Unix & Git for Everyone
-----------------------

### Pre-work

##### 1. Ensure your laptop up to the task of coding

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

##### 2. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

  - [Mac OS X](prework/mac/1_terminal.md)
  - [Ubuntu](prework/ubuntu/1_terminal.md)
  - [Windows](prework/windows/1_terminal.md)

Following completion of these Pre-work assignments, you should:
 - Have a colorized terminal with a Git compatible prompt
 - Be able to open files in Sublime Text via the Terminal
 - Be able to receive a valid response when typing "git --version"

### Testing Out of the Workshop

To test out of the workshop, you will need to complete this assignment. Completion of this assignment, whether independently or at the workshop, is due before the start of your Code Fellows course.

Demonstrate the following skills using **only** your Terminal, your text editor, and your web browser.

##### 1. Create a fork of this repository

##### 2. Clone the fork to your computer

##### 3. Create a new branch called `notes`

##### 4. Checkout the branch `notes`

##### 5. Create a directory with the same name as your GitHub username

For example, `codefellows`

##### 6. Create a `unix_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/unix_notes.txt`

##### 7. Add the notes about what you've learned about Unix to this file

For example,

```
cd <path> Changes the working directory to <path>
ls <path> Lists the directory content of <path>
...
```

##### 8. Create a `git_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/git_notes.txt`

##### 9. Add the notes about what you've learned about Git to this file

For example,

```
git add <file> Adds any changes inside <file> to the staging area
git commit -m '<message>' Commits the staging area to the repository with a <message>
...
```

##### 10. Add these untracked files to the staging area

##### 11. Commit the changes

##### 12. Push the branch to the `origin` remote on GitHub

##### 13. Send a pull request from this branch to Code Fellows' `master` branch
