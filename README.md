Great teachers and TAs! Clear and concise presentation and delievery of subject. Fun class! Thank you!

3: What aspects of the workshop would you change?

The end of the class got a little rushed and I would have like to go over Github a little more.

This is a hard class to teach with such a big group of people all running different OSs and shells. The teachers and TAs did an awesome job of getting everyone where they needed to be.
