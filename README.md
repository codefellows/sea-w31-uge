Unix & Git for Everyone
-----------------------

####1: On a scale of 0 - 10, how likely are you to recommend this workshop to a friend?

Answer: 5

####2: What aspects of the workshop did you like?

Answer: A classroom format paired with TAs being present.

####3: What aspects of the workshop would you change?

The following statement appears on the pre-work to this course: "WARNING: Before running the following commands, replace YOUR FULL NAME and YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS with the name and email from your GitHub account." Consider revising this to explicity instruct students to create a github account prior to the class. Because the preceding instructions for the rest of the pre-work were very explicit step-by-step instructions, I (perhaps stupidly) did not realize I should create the github account before running this command and attending the class. I fell behind as the class was speeding up because I had to pause to create an account.

Consider a faster pace for the morning material, to give more time for the afternoon material.

Consider limiting the number of students per class, or increase the number of TAs.

Easy to fall behind by missing one or two items.





### Pre-work

##### 1. Ensure your laptop up to the task of coding

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

##### 2. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

  - [Mac OS X](prework/mac/1_terminal.md)
  - [Ubuntu](prework/ubuntu/1_terminal.md)
  - [Windows](prework/windows/1_terminal.md)

Following completion of these Pre-work assignments, you should:
 - Have a colorized terminal with a Git compatible prompt
 - Be able to open files in Sublime Text via the Terminal
 - Be able to receive a valid response when typing "git --version"

### Testing Out of the Workshop

To test out of the workshop, you will need to complete this assignment. Completion of this assignment, whether independently or at the workshop, is due before the start of your Code Fellows course.

Demonstrate the following skills using **only** your Terminal, your text editor, and your web browser.

##### 1. Create a fork of this repository

##### 2. Clone the fork to your computer

##### 3. Create a new branch called `notes`

##### 4. Checkout the branch `notes`

##### 5. Create a directory with the same name as your GitHub username

For example, `codefellows`

##### 6. Create a `unix_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/unix_notes.txt`

##### 7. Add the notes about what you've learned about Unix to this file

For example,

```
cd <path> Changes the working directory to <path>
ls <path> Lists the directory content of <path>
...
```

##### 8. Create a `git_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/git_notes.txt`

##### 9. Add the notes about what you've learned about Git to this file

For example,

```
git add <file> Adds any changes inside <file> to the staging area
git commit -m '<message>' Commits the staging area to the repository with a <message>
...
```

##### 10. Add these untracked files to the staging area

##### 11. Commit the changes

##### 12. Push the branch to the `origin` remote on GitHub

##### 13. Send a pull request from this branch to Code Fellows' `master` branch
