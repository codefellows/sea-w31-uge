1: On a scale of 0 - 10, how likely are you to recommend this workshop to a friend?

  10, very likely, assuming it's relevant to them--I feel VERY comfortable exploring the terminal and git now. Even if I'm not completely hands-off at this point, my notes were good enough that they can lead me through everything we did. A lot of this information was built into the prework I remember doing for Foundations I, but I walked away with a much clearer understanding than I did from that prework.

2: What aspects of the workshop did you like?

  The information was clear and I was able to keep up with every step of the tutorial. We didn't get mired in too much side information--we stayed on track with the basic, crucial information we need to get on our feet with Git and Unix.

3: What aspects of the workshop would you change?

  Personally, I did struggle with following the teacher at moments when students in the back were working with TAs or even just chatting. Sometimes people did fall behind and needed help catching up, but maybe a couple more "catch up breaks" could have helped solve those problems so that the tutorials could be heard by everyone. This is a pretty nitpicky complaint, though. All in all not a very big deal. I managed to keep up with everything even with the other sounds.
