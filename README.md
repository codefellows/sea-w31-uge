Unix & Git for Everyone
-----------------------
1. 7
2. The TAs were an amazing help. I appreciated the regular 5 minute breaks.
3. Better communication about the first hour being install help. The first half of the day was very slow and the last hour was rushed when lecture was happening. Better pacing throughout. I would have love access to the slides to follow along or go back if I missed something. I don't know why those wouldn't be available during class.
Also, when I looked at the pre-work it said to do treehouse classes for command line and git. That isn't part of the prework on the site now, but I had done them and it was mostly the same content. So I guess I was expecting some more advanced things like addressing merge conflicts. I did really appreciate the github work.

### Pre-work

##### 1. Ensure your laptop up to the task of coding

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

##### 2. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

  - [Mac OS X](prework/mac/1_terminal.md)
  - [Ubuntu](prework/ubuntu/1_terminal.md)
  - [Windows](prework/windows/1_terminal.md)

Following completion of these Pre-work assignments, you should:
 - Have a colorized terminal with a Git compatible prompt
 - Be able to open files in Sublime Text via the Terminal
 - Be able to receive a valid response when typing "git --version"

### Testing Out of the Workshop

To test out of the workshop, you will need to complete this assignment. Completion of this assignment, whether independently or at the workshop, is due before the start of your Code Fellows course.

Demonstrate the following skills using **only** your Terminal, your text editor, and your web browser.

##### 1. Create a fork of this repository

##### 2. Clone the fork to your computer

##### 3. Create a new branch called `notes`

##### 4. Checkout the branch `notes`

##### 5. Create a directory with the same name as your GitHub username

For example, `codefellows`

##### 6. Create a `unix_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/unix_notes.txt`

##### 7. Add the notes about what you've learned about Unix to this file

For example,

```
cd <path> Changes the working directory to <path>
ls <path> Lists the directory content of <path>
...
```

##### 8. Create a `git_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/git_notes.txt`

##### 9. Add the notes about what you've learned about Git to this file

For example,

```
git add <file> Adds any changes inside <file> to the staging area
git commit -m '<message>' Commits the staging area to the repository with a <message>
...
```

##### 10. Add these untracked files to the staging area

##### 11. Commit the changes

##### 12. Push the branch to the `origin` remote on GitHub

##### 13. Send a pull request from this branch to Code Fellows' `master` branch
