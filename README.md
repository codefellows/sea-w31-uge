1: On a scale of 0 - 10, how likely are you to recommend this workshop to a friend?
10, that is if 10 means highly likely to recommend :)

2: What aspects of the workshop did you like?
I liked that the slides at the end of the class so I can reference them on my own time. They proved to be very, very helpful. I also liked that the TA's were available all class and were willing to share their ideas and direction.

3: What aspects of the workshop would you change?
I would change this to a two-day workshop rather than a one-day. It was obvious that the instructors rushed through the last 2 hours which led to a bit chaos amongst the class. If this were spread across two days then I think people could move at a slower pace and have occasional check ins with the class to see if the pace was comfortable or not. Overall, a great class and will definitely continue to practice what I learned on Saturday. So awesome! Thank you, all.
