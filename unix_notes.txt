Why Unix?

Good for app dev - unix servers are more stable, faster, have good compatability, are free & open
O/S
OSX Linux Android Darwin

Multi Process, multi user

Unix Philoshophy:
Data as plain/text;
Many small programs;
Input-Output Redirection

Kernel - manages hardware, provides security from hackers

Shell - graphical, audible user interface

absolute path begins with "/"
relative does not

/Users/isabellaorgan

ls = list
ls -t = time (modified)
ls - l = long format
ls -lt = long time (modified, with details)
ls -r = reverse (the order)
ls -rt = reverse time (modified)

chain flags together (ls -rtl, etc)

man = manual - built in manual for all Unix commands
(ie man is = manual for list)

/ in man = search for terms (ie errors)

linux = case sensitive
OSX, Windows = case insensitive

USE: (for file names)
lower case
- and _ (dash & underscore)

DO NOT USE: spaces

if you do have a file with a space, use "\" to escape (in place of the space)

d = directory
.. move one level up
ls ~ replaces ~ with absolute path to home directory
. = "right here"/ file you're in
../ = two levels up

cd = return to home directory
~ absolute path to home directory
. = right here
.. = up one level
../ = up 2 levels

History _____ (put a number, ie 5)
lists last 5 things in history

history | less

Unix philosophy:

Do one thing and do it well. Every output can become the input of another program.




Less command - control movement through the reading of a file

pipe |
used to use output of one command as input of another

Saving History
From home directory
history > moving_around.txt

Redirection operator (>)
sends output of command to its left to file on its right

if file does not exist, it is created.

if it does exist, it is overwritten.

If operator is double (>>), output is added.

mkdir = make directory
mv = Move file to directory

Can be used to move & rename.
